# HalfLife
Halflife iteration project (Physics 30)

(OOP + Itr + Recursion)
Halflife - Code that olves each variable in the half life equation. N, No where regular math calculation is used. T is calculated using iteration and T1/2 is calculated using recursion. Graph provided for standard of excellence.

Coded in python
